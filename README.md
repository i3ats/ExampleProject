# ExampleProject
Example using Gradle, Guice, AutoService and a few other convenient things

## What is this for?
The point of this project is to demonstrate a few things:
- How to use Guice
- How to use AutoService to load a Service from a different Module and to make it work with Guice
- How to use a Child Injector to use Runtime dependencies

## Getting started

Run Main.

## Where to go from here
- you could wrap Model and the child Injector in a new Class that operates more like a Service Locator. This might work better in your project.
